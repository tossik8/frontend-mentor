## Overview

A web page with 4 four cards forming a plus(+)

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size


### Links

- Live Site URL: [Netlify](https://legendary-souffle-dc077b.netlify.app/)

## My process

At first I designed the look of a web page for desktop devices and then for mobile phones with the width of a screen smaller than 375px

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass
- Flexbox


### What I learned

Learned how to work with elements whose position property is set to relative. Furthermore, I managed to add the box-shadow property to the cards, which made them look slightly better, in my view.
